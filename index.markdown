# Spencer Davis

**Software Engineer / Full-Stack Developer**

I build modern web applications with a focus on clean, maintainable code. My background in chemical engineering gives me a structured, analytical approach to problem-solving, which I now bring to software development. I graduated from Springboardâ€™s Full-Stack Web Development program in May 2025, and Iâ€™m seeking a full-time software engineering role where I can help create impactful products.
