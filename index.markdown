# Spencer Davis


**Software Engineer / Full-Stack Developer**

Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer with a background in process engineering. I build clean, reliable web applications using React, Node.js, TypeScript, and Python. My approach blends technical precision with iterative improvement, and Iâ€™m looking for an on-site or hybrid role in Tampa Bayâ€”or a fully remote positionâ€”on a team that values strong fundamentals and steady execution.
