# Spencer Davis

**Software Engineer // Full-Stack Developer**

I build modern web applications with a focus on clean, maintainable code. My background in chemical engineering gives me a structured approach to problem-solving, which I now apply to software development. I'm currently looking for a **full-time software engineering role** where I can create impactful products.
