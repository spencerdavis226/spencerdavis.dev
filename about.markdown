# About Me

## Who I Am

I'm Spencer Davis - a full-stack software engineer who transitioned from a career in chemical engineering. I build web applications that are both user-friendly and robust, and I'm passionate about solving real problems with code.

## My Journey

I began my engineering career at Transitions Optical as a Mix Lab Engineer, where I streamlined workflows and developed systems to enhance efficiency in photochromic solution management. Later, at Corning Inc., I further honed my skills by improving manufacturing throughput and implementing innovative process improvements. Along the way, I also explored music production and streaming - experiences that expanded my creativity and adaptability.

After earning my B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of South Florida and my M.Eng. from Cornell, I decided to follow my passion for software development. I'm currently sharpening my skills in Springboard's Full-Stack Web Development program, with plans to graduate in June 2025.

## What I Do

I build modern, maintainable web applications using a diverse range of technologies. My toolkit includes:

- **Front End:** JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Redux, CSS/CSS Modules, and responsive design
- **Back End:** Node.js, Express, and RESTful API development
- **Databases:** MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- **Other Tools & Concepts:** Swift, Python, Agile development, asynchronous programming, object-oriented programming, and an introduction to GraphQL
- **Testing & Deployment:** Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library, and CI/CD workflows

## My Approach

I focus on writing clean, scalable code that stands the test of time. Whether I'm working alone or as part of a team, I aim to deliver solutions that are robust, well-documented, and easy to maintain.

## Interests & Goals

I'm driven by the challenge of solving real-world problems and continuously improving my craft. I'm looking for a full-time role where I can contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with a talented team, and keep growing as a developer.
