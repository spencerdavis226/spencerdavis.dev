# About Me

## Who I Am

I’m Spencer Davis — a full‑stack software engineer with a master’s in chemical engineering from Cornell. I blend rigorous process‑engineering discipline with modern web‑dev skills to build clean, reliable applications using React, Node.js, TypeScript, and Python.

## My Journey

I started in manufacturing: first automating barcode tracking at Transitions Optical, then optimizing high‑temperature glass processes at Corning, where I co‑designed patent‑pending equipment. Nights and weekends I produced music and ran a 25 K‑follower livestream channel on Microsoft Mixer— sharpening my instincts for UX, analytics, and rapid iteration.
In 2024‑25 I completed Springboard’s 800‑hour Software Engineering Career Track, shipping full‑stack projects with test‑driven development and Agile workflows. That program pulled my engineering rigor and creative problem‑solving into one focus: building production‑ready software.

## What I Do

I build modern, maintainable web applications using a broad range of technologies:

- **Front End:** React, Next.js, TypeScript/JavaScript, Redux, CSS Modules, responsive design<br>
- **Back End & APIs:** Node.js, Express, REST, GraphQL<br>
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB<br>
- **Other tools and concepts:** Python, Swift, Git/GitHub, Agile/Scrum, async programming, OOP<br>
- **Testing & DevOps:** Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library, CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions)<br>

## My Approach

I prefer measurable goals, small iterations, and fast feedback—whether that’s red‑green‑refactor in TDD or quick feature flags in production. Clear docs and repeatable processes keep teams unblocked and users happy.

## Interests & Goals

I’m targeting full‑stack or backend roles in Tampa Bay (on‑site or hybrid) or fully remote positions on product teams that value clean code, steady delivery, and continuous learning.
