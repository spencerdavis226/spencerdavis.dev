# About Me

## Who I Am

I’m Spencer Davis, a software engineer with a background in full-stack development and chemical engineering. I love technology, problem-solving, and building modern web applications.

## Background

Before moving into software, I worked as a process engineer at Corning Inc., where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I earned my bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of South Florida and my master’s from Cornell University. That background gave me a structured, methodical approach to tackling challenges, which I now apply to software development.

Along the way, I’ve also been involved in music production, content creation, and streaming. These experiences helped me develop adaptability, creativity, and an eye for user engagement—skills that carry over into web and software development.

## What I Do

I specialize in full-stack web development, with a focus on JavaScript, React, and backend services. My work includes:

- Building web applications with React, Node.js, and Express
- Designing clean, intuitive user interfaces
- Developing backend systems and working with databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- Contributing to open-source projects and continuously learning new technologies

## Approach to Development

I focus on writing maintainable, scalable, and efficient code. Software should be built with strong architecture, clean code, and a user-first mindset. Whether I’m working on a project solo or collaborating on a team, I prioritize clear structure and long-term maintainability.

## Interests and Goals

- Building applications that improve user experiences and solve real problems
- Exploring game development and combining my passion for gaming with software engineering
- Working with a team that values creativity, learning, and impactful development
- Expanding my knowledge of software architecture, cloud computing, and AI

## Let’s Connect

I’m always open to discussing projects, collaborations, or anything tech-related.
