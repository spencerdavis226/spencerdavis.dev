# About Me

## Who I Am

I’m Spencer Davis, a process engineer who moved into full‑stack development. The same data‑driven mindset that helped improve optical‑fiber manufacturing now guides the web apps I build.

## My Journey

I got my start in manufacturing, first building barcode tools at Transitions Optical and later refining prototype glass processes at Corning. Producing music and livestreaming on the side taught me how to connect with people and think creatively. Springboard’s software bootcamp pulled it all together, giving me the skills to turn that mix of analysis and creativity into code.

## What I Do

I build modern, maintainable web applications using a broad range of technologies:

- **Front End:** React, Next.js, TypeScript/JavaScript, Redux, CSS Modules, responsive design<br>
- **Back End & APIs:** Node.js, Express, REST, GraphQL<br>
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB<br>
- **Other tools and concepts:** Python, Swift, Git/GitHub, Agile/Scrum, async programming, OOP<br>
- **Testing & DevOps:** Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library, CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions)<br>

## My Approach

I like clear goals, small experiments, quick feedback, and solid notes. That structure keeps projects moving and surprises to a minimum.

## Interests & Goals

I’m looking for an on‑site or hybrid role in Tampa Bay, or a fully remote position, where I can turn tough problems into clear software and grow alongside a strong team.
