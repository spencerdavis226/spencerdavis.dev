# About Me

## Who I Am

I’m Spencer Davis, a software engineer with a background in chemical engineering and full-stack development. I love technology, problem-solving, and crafting user-centric web applications.

## Background

Before coding, I honed my analytical skills as a process engineer at Corning Inc. (improving throughput by ~15%). I earned a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of South Florida and an M.Eng. from Cornell. Alongside engineering, I explored music production and streaming—ventures that sharpened my adaptability and creativity.

## What I Do

I specialize in full-stack web development, focusing on JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Express. My current toolkit includes:

- **Front End**: React, CSS Modules, Responsive UI
- **Back End**: Node.js, Express, REST APIs
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Testing & Deployment**: Jest, Vitest, CI/CD workflows
- **Continuous Learning**: Swift, Python, plus game development concepts

## Approach to Development

I prioritize writing maintainable, scalable code that meets real user needs. Whether working solo or in a team, I emphasize robust architecture, clarity, and continuous improvement.

## Interests & Goals

- Delivering applications that elevate user experiences and solve real-world problems
- Combining software engineering with my passion for gaming
- Contributing to open-source projects and learning more about cloud and AI
- Securing a **full-time** software engineering role with a team that values creativity and innovation

## Let’s Connect

I’m always open to discussions about projects, collaborations, or anything tech-related.
